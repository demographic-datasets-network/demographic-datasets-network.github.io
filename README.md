## Welcome to the Repository for Small Area Datasets

The purpose of this repository  is to support the:
 - development and evaluation of small area **estimation** methods
 - development and evaluation of small area **forecasting** methods
 - the **researchers and practitioners** working in the small area field
 

We **define small area** as datasets where _most_ of the time series are for areas with total populations <100,000  or
spatially distributed data with a resolution of 100m2 at the equator (or better).  

To make these datasets as accessible as possible it is provided **in csv format**.

We invite demographers to **contribute to this repo** and to make suggestions on how to improve the way that the data is organised.  

If you would like to contribute or make suggestions please contact irina at: irina.grossman@unimelb.edu.au
