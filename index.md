## Welcome to the Repository for Small Area Demographic Datasets

This repository contains small area population estimates and demographic components of change.

The purpose of this repository is to support research on:
 - the development and evaluation of small area **estimation** methods;
 - the development and evaluation of small area **forecasting** methods; and
 - **researchers and practitioners** working in the small area field.

We define **small areas** as geographical areas with total populations <100,000, though we do include datasets where the majority of areas fall under this population threshold.

To make these datasets as accessible as possible, files are provided in **csv format**.

We invite demographers to **contribute to this repository** and to make suggestions on how to improve the way that the data is organised.

If you would like to contribute or make suggestions please contact Irina at: **irina.grossman@unimelb.edu.au**
